# Kiq.js
Blazing fast virtual node component based library

## Javascript should not be pain
This library allows you to don't care about DOM and DOM updates, you will only work with data and leave DOM on us

## What about speeeeeeed?
Kiq.js is faster than libraries that doing same thing like React.js, Vue.js, etc...

## How can be faster than these libraries?
It is optimized by requestAnimationFrame, bundling DOM changes into one bundle and do it in one time, so browser don't recalculate reflow and repaint every time, 
small size (under 2Kb min + gzip) and simple data control

## Can this library be faster than Svelte?
Svelte is compiler and Kiq is javascript library, but sometimes Kiq can be faster and smaller than Svelte bundle

## What about components?
Components are simple javsacript classes (constructor funcitons)
